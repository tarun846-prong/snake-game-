# snake-game-
This is a classic Snake Game implementation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in length. If the snake collides with itself or the walls, the game is over. The goal is to get the highest score possible by eating as much food as possible without crashing.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake: up, down, left, and right.
3. The snake moves continuously, so be careful not to run into yourself or any walls.
4. Eat the food to increase your score and lengthen the snake.
5. The game ends when you collide with yourself or the walls.

## Technologies Used
